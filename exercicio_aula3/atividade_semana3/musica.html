                There comes a time<br>
                When we heed a certain call<br>
                When the world must come together as one<br>
                There are people dying<br>
                Oh, and it's time to lend a hand to life<br>
                The greatest gift of all<br>
                We can't go on<br>
                Pretending day-by-day<br>
                That someone, somewhere soon make a change<br>
                We're all a part of God's great big family<br>
                And the truth, you know, love is all we need<br>
                We are the world<br>
                We are the children<br>
                We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving<br>
                There's a choice we're making<br>
                We're saving our own lives<br>
                It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me<br>
                Oh, send them your heart<br>
                So they know that someone cares<br>
                And their lives will be stronger and free<br>
                As God has shown us by turning stones to bread<br>
                And so we all must lend a helping hand<br>
                We are the world<br>
                We are the children<br>
                We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving<br>
                Oh, there's a choice we're making<br>
                We're saving our own lives<br>
                It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me<br>
                When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all<br>
                But if you just believe there's no way we can fall<br>
                Well, well, well, well let us realize<br>
                Oh, that a change can only come<br>
                When we stand together as one, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
                We are the world<br>
                We are the children<br>
                We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving<br>
                There's a choice we're making<br>
