    <h2>Sex On Fire</h2>
    <h4>Kings Of Leon</h4> Lay where you're laying, don't make a sound
    <br> I know they're watching, they're watching
    <br>
    <br> All the commotion, the kiddie-like play
    <br> Has people talking, talking
    <br>
    <br> You... Your sex is on fire
    <br>
    <br> Dark of the alley, the breaking of day
    <br> The head while I'm driving, I'm driving
    <br>
    <br> Soft lips are open, knuckles are pale
    <br> Feels like you're dying, you're dying
    <br>
    <br> You... Your sex is on fire
    <br> Consumed with what's to transpire
    <br>
    <br> Hot as a fever, rattling bones
    <br> I can just taste it, taste it
    <br>
    <br> If it's not forever, if it's just tonight
    <br> Oh it's still the greatest, the greatest
    <br>
    <br> You... Your sex is on fire
    <br> You... Your sex is on fire
    <br> Consumed with what's to transpire
    <br>
    <br> And you... Your sex is on fire
    <br> Consumed with what's to transpire
    <br>

    <h2>Numb</h2>
    <h4>Linkin Park</h4> I'm tired of being what you want me to be
    <br> Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
    <br> I don't know what you're expecting of me
    <br> Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
    <br> Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
    <br> Every step that I take is another mistake to you
    <br> Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
    <br>
    <br> I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    <br> Become so tired, so much more aware
    <br> By becoming this all I want to do
    <br> Is be more like me and be less like you
    <br>
    <br> Can't you see that you're smothering me?
    <br> Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
    <br> 'Cause everything that you thought I would be
    <br> Has fallen apart right in front of you
    <br> Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
    <br> Every step that I take is another mistake to you Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow And every second I waste is more than I can take!
    <br>
    <br> I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    <br> Become so tired, so much more aware
    <br> By becoming this all I want to do
    <br> Is be more like me and be less like you
    <br>
    <br> And I know I may end up failing too
    <br> But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you
    <br>
    <br> I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    <br> Become so tired, so much more aware
    <br> By becoming this all I want to do
    <br> Is be more like me and be less like you
    <br>
    <br> I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    <br> I'm tired of being what you want me to be
    <br> I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
    <br> I'm tired of being what you want me to be

    <h2>Times Like These</h2>
    <h4>Foo Fighters</h4> I, I'm a one way motorway
    <br> I'm the one that drives away
    <br> Then follows you back home
    <br> I, I'm a street light shining
    <br> I'm a wild light blinding bright
    <br> Burning off alone
    <br>
    <br> It's times like these you learn to live again
    <br> It's times like these you give and give again
    <br> It's times like these you learn to love again
    <br> It's times like these time and time again
    <br>
    <br> I, I'm a new day rising
    <br> I'm a brand new sky
    <br> To hang the stars upon tonight
    <br> I am a little divided
    <br> Do I stay or run away
    <br> And leave it all behind?
    <br>
    <br> It's times like these you learn to live again
    <br> It's times like these you give and give again
    <br> It's times like these you learn to love again
    <br> It's times like these time and time again
    <br>
    <br> It's times like these you learn to live again
    <br> It's times like these you give and give again
    <br> It's times like these you learn to love again
    <br> It's times like these time and time again
    <br>
    <br> It's times like these you learn to live again
    <br> It's times like these you give and give again
    <br> It's times like these you learn to love again
    <br> It's times like these time and time again
    <br>
    <br> It's times like these you learn to live again
    <br> It's times like these you give and give again
    <br> It's times like these you learn to love again
    <br> It's times like these time and time again
